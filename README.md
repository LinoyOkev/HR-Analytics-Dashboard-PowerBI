## Overview

The HR Analytics Dashboard is a Power BI solution designed to help HR professionals monitor and manage employee data effectively.

- Identify attrition patterns and take proactive retention measures.
- Understand the age and gender distribution of employees.
- Evaluate job satisfaction levels across different roles.
